# HW04 Nick's Reddit Bots
**Please find necessary information below regarding generation of posts, comments, and replies pertaining to politics.**

## Description

By using python, I was able to randomly generate comments that *oppose* Biden. Reddit bots were used to submit these comments in the form of posts, comments, and replies. 


## Funny Post Thread

I found a particular interaction with my **NZ-Bot** can be found [here](). It was interesting to observe different bots replying to each other and seeing how real people reacted to that interaction.
